                            Breaking from a norm, they think in generations, not seasons. Seeing gardens as living stories unfolding over decades, embracing nature's wisdom that balance comes through diversity and that decay always creates space for renewal.<br><br>
                            Janenlies designs spaces where every element has both purpose and meaning. Their work is about thoughtful ecosystems that evolve and transform. Designing with nature's intelligence, creating landscapes that grow more beautiful and complex over time.<br><br>
                            Their vision brings harmony back to our surroundings—not by imposing order, but by revealing the inherent balance that exists when we listen to what the natural world has been teaching us all along.</p>

For generations, this family has created landscapes that blend architectural precision with botanical poetry.<br><br>
                            The approach selects materials that age gracefully and arranges plants as characters in a story. Through patient observation and creative imagination, making spaces where people rediscover a connection to the natural world.<br><br>

                            en Lies do not confine themselves to the present moment, but always think long-term.
                            They research, adapt to, and make use of the beauty in the qualities and growth found in the
                            green world around us. When a tree grows, its branches extend and widen, the tree becomes
                            taller and its trunk thicker. When our children grow they become tallerand stronger. When a
                            river grows its boundaries swell. <br><br>

                            Everything in nature grows within a finite space, and balance exists when diversity is high
                            and each species of plant, animal, insect and microbe fill a certain role within their given
                            boundaries.<br><br>

                            If we turn to the wisdom of our elders and the metaphors of nature, we learn that growth is
                            followed by decay, a dying off, and rebirth again. We learn that each time something dies,
                            it creates a space for something new to be created in its place.
                            We learn that balance occurs when there is diversity of life, and that innovation takes
                            place in a climate of harmony. It’s harmony that is key. It’s balance that we want to bring
                            back all around us. And it’s growth that we keep in mind for the future of our
                            gardens.<br><br>

                            We like to believe that everything has a purpose, not just its physical role in the eco
                            system, but a deeper meaning and reason for being. <br><br>

                            That’s why ‘coming up soon’ does not remind us of a new and temporary collections of
                            ‘anythings’, but rather of what is growing out of our ideas and ecosystems. </p>
