                    do not confine themselves to the present moment, but always think long-term.
                    They research, adapt to, and make use of the beauty in the qualities and growth found in the green
                    world around us. When a tree grows, its branches extend and widen, the tree becomes taller and its
                    trunk thicker. When our children grow they become tallerand stronger. When a river grows its
                    boundaries swell.<br><br>

                    Everything in nature grows within a finite space, and balance exists when diversity is high and each
                    species of plant, animal, insect and microbe fill a certain role within their given boundaries.<br>

                    If we turn to the wisdom of our elders and the metaphors of nature, we learn that growth is followed
                    by decay, a dying off, and rebirth again. We learn that each time something dies, it creates a space
                    for something new to be created in its place.<br><br>
                    We learn that balance occurs when there is diversity of life, and that innovation takes place in a
                    climate of harmony. It’s harmony that is key. It’s balance that we want to bring back all around us.
                    And it’s growth that we keep in mind for the future of our gardens.<br><br>

                    We like to believe that everything has a purpose, not just its physical role in the eco system, but
                    a deeper meaning and reason for being<br><br>

                    That’s why ‘coming up soon’ does not remind us of a new and temporary collections of ‘anythings’,  but rather of what is growing out of our ideas and ecosystems. </p>
