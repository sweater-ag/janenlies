                            green
                            world around us. When a tree grows, its branches extend and widen, the tree becomes taller
                            and
                            its
                            trunk thicker. When our children grow they become tallerand stronger. When a river grows its
                            boundaries swell.<br><br>

                            Everything in nature grows within a finite space, and balance exists when diversity is high
                            and
                            each
                            species of plant, animal, insect and microbe fill a certain role within their given
                            boundaries.<br>

                            If we turn to the wisdom of our elders and the metaphors of nature, we learn that growth is
                            followed
                            by decay, a dying off, and rebirth again. We learn that each time something dies, it creates
                            a
                            space
                            for something new to be created in its place.<br><br>
                            We learn that balance occurs when there is diversity of life, and that innovation takes
                            place in
                            a
                            climate of harmony. It’s harmony that is key. It’s balance that we want to bring back all
                            around
                            us.
                            And it’s growth that we keep in mind for the future of our gardens.<br><br>

                            We like to believe that everything has a purpose, not just its physical role in the eco
                            system,
                            but
                            a deeper meaning and reason for being<br><br>

                            That’s why ‘coming up soon’ does not remind us of a new and temporary collections of
